## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, PropTypes, emotion,  MUI

Create a simple react app that uses react hooks for simple state management like useState and useEffect, implement creating components and proptypes for checking if the props are valid, use emotion for simple styled elements, and lastly implement MUI for the button.

## Lessons Learned:

- How useEffect works.
- PropTypes for strict implementation of props.
- emotion styled components
